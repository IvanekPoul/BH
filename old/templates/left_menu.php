Hello, I am Katerina. 

<br>

My passion for photos was inherited from my dad and grandpa. I have been enthusiastic about computer photo manipulation since I was a kid, later in connection with 3D virtual creation.

<br>

I am passionate not only about taking shots but also about graphics including post-production (retouching) of your photos, I will help you with choice of clothes and localities for your portrait pictures.

<br>

As a graduated architect, I am focused on details and creative approach, the final product must reflect your both inner and outer beauty and capture your unique personality.
