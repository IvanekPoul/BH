We offer to our clients photo-sessions outdoor (park, countryside, town, beach, wharf etc.) and indoor (our photo studio, church, concert hall, exhibition centre etc.).
For the best studio photography we use 3 professional 600 W studio flash-lights and various backgrounds. 
Outdoors is commonly used collapsible reflector or non-frontal remote flash.
In a special occasion we are able mooving our studio equipment into your choosen place (workshop, church...). All our images go through software post-processing turning you into profesionally looking photo model and making art work 
from common plain shot.

POST-PROCESSING
  <br/>    
<strong>Basic</strong> post-processing contains white balance, colour and exposure correction, sharpening, cropping, etc.
  <br/> 
  <br/>
<strong>Advanced</strong> post-processing is highly recommended and raises your beauty even more. It contains skin blemish and wrinkles retouching, 
makeup corrections and smoothing, removal of stray hairs, figure shaping, removal of tattoo & piercing if required, clothes touch-ups, 
background adjustments, lighting corrections, etc.
