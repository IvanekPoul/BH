*We take many shots during the session and after go through first selection and deleting. This number means amount of best photos which will
advance to your on-line selection.
 <br/>
 <br/>
**This number means number of photos chosen by you on-line. The same amount will go through post-production (basic or advanced) 
and is going to be supplied to you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
***Post-processing is an integral part of final product, we do not provide untouched photos. Post-production examples are shoved 
in <a href="./work.php" target="blank" target="blank">How Do We Work</a> section.
