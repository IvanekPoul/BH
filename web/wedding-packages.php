A price for a wedding photography photo-session depends on difficulity of realisation (how big the wedding will be, our studio flashes in a church, number of photo-assistants, "Kiss" Package in a particular place etc.).
The price will be completed after consultation and liason with client.
<br/>
<br/>
*We take many shots during the session and then go through first selection and deleting. This number means amount of best photos advanced to your on-line selection. 
<br/>
<br/>
**This number means number of photos chosen by you on-line. The same amount will go through post-processing (basic or advanced) and is going to be supplied to you on DVD/CD.
<br/>
<br/>
***Post-processing is an integral part of final product, we do not provide untouched photos. Post-processing examples are shown in <a href="./work.php" target="blank">How Do We Work</a> section.
